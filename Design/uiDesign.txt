The user interface of “Doodle” is intended to be simple and straightforward. “Doodle” users can interact with the program with little drawing skill and still enjoy themselves, all the way up to people who would prefer to use the app for more than just interesting patterns. The program utilizes (for the most part) white backgrounds so the doodles can take precedent, and the control panel in draw and rotate mode is made to be easy to understand.

The control panel provides default colors for users who might not know what RGB values they’d want to input, and defaults the line thickness to one pixel. However, if a “Doodle” user would like to further customize their lines or rotations, they have the option to do so via the clearly labeled control panel. Additionally, the mode label in the bottom left corner of the screen is always present to let the user know exactly what mode they’re on. In modes like rotate and shape mode, it also provides the number of points of rotation or polygon sides the user currently has selected.

Finally, the help menu is always accessible by pressing ‘h’. The user is first introduced to the help menu when they end “Doodle” so there can be no confusion about the controls. Each function is clearly laid out in concise language in the help screen.

Many drawing programs online and as desktop applications (like GIMP, Photoshop, or even MS Paint) have lots of features centered around drawing, have many complicated features that aren’t typically used, and are often geared towards artists. That is not the aim of “Doodle”. “Doodle” is meant to be for exactly that: doodling. It’s meant to provide some fun for a non-artist who wants to make some interesting, computer generated art. This is why the interface is so simple and doesn’t focus so much on giving the user “artist tools,” like a hex color generator or different brushes. “Doodle” prioritizes ease of understanding and fun over special features.
